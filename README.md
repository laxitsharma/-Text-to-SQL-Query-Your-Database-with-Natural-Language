# -Text-to-SQL-Query-Your-Database-with-Natural-Language
This project is a simple but powerful Streamlit web application that allows users to interact with a SQLite database using natural language. Leveraging LangChain, Groq LLM (LLaMA3-8B), and LangChain's SQL prompt engineering, this app automatically converts English questions into valid SQL queries, executes them, and displays the results.
