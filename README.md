# -Text-to-SQL-Query-Your-Database-with-Natural-Language
This project is a simple but powerful Streamlit web application that allows users to interact with a SQLite database using natural language. Leveraging LangChain, Groq LLM (LLaMA3-8B), and LangChain's SQL prompt engineering, this app automatically converts English questions into valid SQL queries, executes them, and displays the results.

âœ… Query a preloaded STUDENT database (columns: NAME, COURSE, SECTION, MARKS)

âœ… Powered by LangChain and Groq LLM

âœ… Interactive and user-friendly Streamlit interface

âœ… Works locally with SQLite backend

ðŸ“‹ Example Questions You Can Ask
"What are the average marks class wise?"

"Name of the student who scored the highest marks?"

"Who has the second highest marks in the DEVOPS course?"
